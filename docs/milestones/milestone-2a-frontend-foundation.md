# Milestone 2A — Frontend Foundation

## Status

✅ Completed

---

## Objective

Build the frontend foundation before introducing authentication, Firebase integration, or business features.

This milestone establishes:

- Frontend architecture
- Styling architecture
- Layout system
- Component system
- Navigation structure
- Design language

The goal is to create a scalable React/Next.js foundation that can support future application features.

---

## Business Context

The final product is a SaaS-style job search platform.

Before implementing application tracking, resume management, and analytics, the application requires a reusable frontend architecture.

This milestone focuses entirely on user experience and maintainability.

No backend integration should occur during this milestone.

---

## Deliverables

### Frontend Folder Structure

```txt
frontend/
│
├── app/
│
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   └── ui/
│
├── hooks/
├── services/
├── styles/
├── types/
└── public/
```

---

## Styling Architecture

### Goal

Establish a scalable styling system.

### Required Files

```txt
styles/
│
├── globals.scss
├── _variables.scss
├── _mixins.scss
└── _reset.scss
```

### Requirements

- Use SCSS Modules
- Use shared variables
- Use shared mixins
- No Tailwind
- No CSS-in-JS
- No inline styling

---

## Layout System

### Goal

Create reusable application layouts.

### Components

```txt
components/layout/
│
├── AppShell/
├── Header/
├── Sidebar/
└── PageContainer/
```

### Responsibilities

#### AppShell

Provides:

- Header
- Sidebar
- Content Area

#### Header

Provides:

- Application branding
- Navigation actions

#### Sidebar

Provides:

- Dashboard navigation
- Future feature navigation

#### PageContainer

Provides:

- Consistent spacing
- Page layout wrapper

---

## UI Component System

### Goal

Create reusable UI primitives.

### Components

```txt
components/ui/
│
├── Button/
├── Card/
├── Input/
├── EmptyState/
├── Badge/
└── Spinner/
```

### Requirements

Components must:

- Use TypeScript
- Use SCSS Modules
- Be reusable
- Avoid business logic

---

## Routing Structure

### Public Routes

```txt
/
```

Landing page.

### Internal Routes

```txt
/dashboard
```

Dashboard shell.

Future routes will be added later.

---

## Landing Page

### Goal

Present the product professionally.

### Sections

#### Hero

Display:

- Product Name
- Product Description
- CTA Button

#### Features

Display:

- Application Tracking
- Resume Analysis
- Interview Preparation
- Analytics

#### Technology Stack

Display:

- Next.js
- React
- FastAPI
- Firebase

### Success Criteria

Landing page appears professional and SaaS-like.

---

## Dashboard Shell

### Goal

Create the first authenticated-style application experience.

### Required Sections

#### Header

Contains:

- Logo
- Navigation

#### Sidebar

Contains placeholder links:

```txt
Dashboard
Applications
Resumes
Interview Prep
Analytics
Settings
```

#### Main Content

Display:

```txt
Welcome to Career Copilot
```

### Success Criteria

Dashboard feels like a real SaaS application.

---

## Import Standards

Use alias imports.

Example:

```ts
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/Button";
```

Avoid:

```ts
import { Button } from "../../../../components/ui/Button";
```

---

## TypeScript Standards

### Required

- Strict typing
- Explicit interfaces
- Shared type definitions

### Avoid

```ts
any
```

unless absolutely necessary.

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Why SCSS Modules?

Benefits:

- Component isolation
- Strong CSS fundamentals
- Easier maintenance
- Recruiter-friendly architecture

### Why AppShell?

Benefits:

- Reusable dashboard structure
- Consistent layout
- Easier future development

### Why Separate Layout and UI Components?

Benefits:

- Clear responsibilities
- Easier testing
- Better reuse

---

## Files Expected

### New

```txt
styles/
components/layout/
components/ui/
hooks/
services/
types/
```

### Modified

```txt
app/layout.tsx
app/page.tsx
app/dashboard/page.tsx
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria
